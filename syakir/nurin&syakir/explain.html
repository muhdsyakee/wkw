        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
        web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        its appearance.

        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
        and surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not
        display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

    <p id="idcss">
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a
        document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
        XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its
        presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
        multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
        complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page
        load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

    <p id="idjs">
        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the
        World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
        webpage behavior.

        Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized
        in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
        It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
        supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
        interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
        Object Model (DOM).

        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
        facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly
        in design

        jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event
        handling, CSS animations, and Ajax.It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. As
        of August 2022, jQuery is used by 77% of the 10 million most popular websites.Web analysis indicates that it
        is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, having at least three to four times more usage
        than any other JavaScript library.

        jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations,
        handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create
        plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level
        interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the
        jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.
